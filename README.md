# Project 3: From Portland to Portland



**Description of project**

This project is a web page made to practice and text responsiveness. The goal here is to create a page that matches the Figma design at the 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px screen sizes.

**Technologies used**

To finish this project we use a combination of flex box, grid, and responsive tools (i.e. percentages) in order to make the page work fluently.
